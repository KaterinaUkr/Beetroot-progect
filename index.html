            Solis group is a new venture created with investments from and collaboration with XBTO International, XBTO Ventures and
            Phil Potter, formerly of bitfinex. Stablehouse is intended to launch a first-of-its-kind clearing house for stablecoins
            that seeks to promote the next phase of the market’s development.
            The API-enabled, centralized platform addresses the key issues of inconsistent liquidity, stability and accessibility
            which are currently preventing the stablecoin market from reaching critical mass.
